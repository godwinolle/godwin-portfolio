                <span role="img" aria-label="hand">👋🏾</span> Hello, world! I'm Godwin Rodrick, and I have an 
                instagram known as @godwin.codes. I'm currently 
                learning Software Engineering at Towson University. As I've grown as a 
                developer, I've also grown my interest in cyber security and now have 
                a beginner understanding of the importance cyber security plays into code. 
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Through these experiences,  I've had the opportunity to create memorable 
                products that are not only enjoyable to use but are written in code that's 
                maintainable and easy to understand.
